# CS50-Final-Project
#### Video Demo:  TODO
### Description:
This Web App is going to be a text based game that will allow the user to create a mini space empire. It is very, very loosely based on the 1992 RTS Imperium Galactica 2. The player will start with a small amount of resources and will be able to start building their base to gather more resources. After getting their buildings set up and making a Ship Factory they will be able to start building ships. Ship provide the player with points that will then place them on a leader board viewable by all players. The web based game scales with level of buildings giving access to bigger ships, which in turn give more points.

The project has been made using the VSC IDE and the Django Framework. The project is a mix of Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Django’s template language which is much like Jinja. The project uses many Django database models in the background also.


### Progress:
##### 13th October 2021

Approaching the final project of CS50 is a daunting challenge. The given brief being so open and without guidelines is anxiety inducing! What should my project be? What should I write it in? What should the scope be? Well this is the start of my journey and I don’t really have an answer to any of those questions. I believe that before I start writing code for this project that I want to learn more about different technologies. I want to focus and learn more about a particular language and environments surrounding it. I think I am going to pick python to be my focus. I will also concentrate on starting other courses from Harvard’s Computer Science family such as CS50W and CS50AI.

##### 14th October 2021

After having a think about different options for my final project, I have initially decided to create a Discord Bot. The Discord bot will act as an interactive text based RPG. The premise of the RPG will be a Software Student attempting to learn Computer Science and Coding. The user will type commands into a discord channel and the bot will respond accordingly. My first step is to set a bot up.

###### Update 14th

I setup a Discord Bot and made it do the obligatory “Hello, World!” Whilst then planning the scope and features for the bot I realised it was far beyond what I would be able to do as a solo project in a reasonable amount of time. The main reason for this is that the bot would need to be “multiplayer” for users to be able to interact and play the game with their own character. The challenge of implementing this for this project is beyond what I think is necessary and practical. Saying that I have not completely given up. Using the knowledge gained from CS50 I believe I could implement something similar as a web app. This would require creating a Front End and Back End but I believe I can use technologies previously used in the course to do this.

##### 19th October 2021

With making the decision to make my Final Project a Web App I enrolled in CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. This will mean that finishing this project will take longer but the end product should be of a higher quality.

##### 28th October 2021

Having now completed the first 5 lectures in CS50w, I am now going to use the Django framework instead of Flask. I am also going to be using VSC as my IDE instead of the CS50 IDE. I am currently in the process of cloning the git repository there and removing the old flask files and creating a new Django project. The first part I will implement for the Django Project will be the users Login/Logout function. I will also fill out a brief description of what I initially think that this Web Application will be.

##### 3rd November 2021

The more I progress with the web app the more I am having to read documentation and constantly google things that I don’t yet know. The project has become less about the final product and more about learning Django and Python. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it is just not what I was expecting. My project currently has a Register/Login/Logout feature and the main page setup for the game. Currently game wise the player can update their resources by clicking a submit button which sends a post request. Next will be to give the player “buildings” which can be upgraded and when upgraded will provide more resources. This will all be tied in with a leaderboard.

##### 10th November 2021

The project is now in a 'playable' state and ready for its initial release/submission. There are a few things I want to add and design changes I want to make but I have met the requirements for submission and I have already spent a lot of time on this project. Any changes made will be after it is submitted to CS50
