Approaching the final project of CS50 is a daunting challenge. The given brief being so open and without guidelines is anxiety inducing! What should my project be? What should I write it in? What should the scope be? Well this is the start of my journey and I don’t really have an answer to any of those questions. I believe that before I start writing code for this project that I want to learn more about different technologies. I want to focus and learn more about a particular language and environments surrounding it. I think I am going to pick python to be my focus. I will also concentrate on starting other courses from Harvard’s Computer Science family such as CS50W and CS50AI.

After having a think about different options for my final project, I have initially decided to create a Discord Bot. The Discord bot will act as an interactive text based RPG. The premise of the RPG will be a Software Student attempting to learn Computer Science and Coding. The user will type commands into a discord channel and the bot will respond accordingly. My first step is to set a bot up.
