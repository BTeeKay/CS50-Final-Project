Approaching the final project of CS50 is a daunting challenge. The given brief being so open and without guidelines is anxiety inducing! What should my project be? What should I write it in? What should the scope be? Well this is the start of my journey and I don’t really have an answer to any of those questions. I believe that before I start writing code for this project that I want to learn more about different technologies. I want to focus and learn more about a particular language and environments surrounding it. I think I am going to pick python to be my focus. I will also concentrate on starting other courses from Harvard’s Computer Science family such as CS50W and CS50AI.
