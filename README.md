Approaching the final project of CS50 is a daunting challenge. The given brief being so open and without guidelines is anxiety inducing! What should my project be? What should I write it in? What should the scope be? Well this is the start of my journey and I don’t really have an answer to any of those questions. I believe that before I start writing code for this project that I want to learn more about different technologies. I want to focus and learn more about a particular language and environments surrounding it. I think I am going to pick python to be my focus. I will also concentrate on starting other courses from Harvard’s Computer Science family such as CS50W and CS50AI.

After having a think about different options for my final project, I have initially decided to create a Discord Bot. The Discord bot will act as an interactive text based RPG. The premise of the RPG will be a Software Student attempting to learn Computer Science and Coding. The user will type commands into a discord channel and the bot will respond accordingly. My first step is to set a bot up.

###### Update 14th

I setup a Discord Bot and made it do the obligatory “Hello, World!” Whilst then planning the scope and features for the bot I realised it was far beyond what I would be able to do as a solo project in a reasonable amount of time. The main reason for this is that the bot would need to be “multiplayer” for users to be able to interact and play the game with their own character. The challenge of implementing this for this project is beyond what I think is necessary and practical. Saying that I have not completely given up. Using the knowledge gained from CS50 I believe I could implement something similar as a web app. This would require creating a Front End and Back End but I believe I can use technologies previously used in the course to do this.

With making the decision to make my Final Project a Web App I enrolled in CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. This will mean that finishing this project will take longer but the end product should be of a higher quality.
